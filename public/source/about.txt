I am a dedicated software engineer with a strong foundation in computer engineering and
a passion for web development. My coding journey began during my studies in Computer Engineering,
where I co-founded Unect Jr., an IT junior enterprise. Over two and a half years,
I honed my skills by developing various projects, primarily using Java, while independently
studying JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
 
Upon completing my degree, I pursued a six-month English language program in Australia in 2019.
After returning to Brazil, I joined Bluelab as a Software Engineer, where I have been
developing integrations with voice bots and chatbots. Bluelab specializes in
automated customer service solutions, offering advanced chatbot and voicebot technologies to
enhance customer interactions across multiple channels. 
 
I am now channeling my expertise into personal projects, including the development of my portfolio.
My technical proficiency encompasses ReactJS and Node.js, and I maintain an active presence on GitHub
under the username "rodalladea", where I share my projects and repositories. Notably,
I created "ro.dalla.dev," a personal portfolio designed to emulate the aesthetics and functionality
of NeoVim and TMUX, providing a terminal-inspired user experience. This portfolio is built using Next.js,
React, and Tailwind CSS.
 
Through my academic background, professional experience, and personal initiatives, I continue to
advance my skills and contribute to the field of software development.
